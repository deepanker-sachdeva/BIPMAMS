Bicycle Parts Manufacturing Management System

An application to exhibit the potential of a DBMS based system which can replace the old MS Foxpro system that is currently being used in all such facilities. Its scalability, fast and real time updations and ease of use while maintaining the data with all the required complexity in the backend is what makes it the best. Its designed to be implemented in a bicycle parts manufacturing facility to store and organize customer data, sales data, raw-material data, stock details, employee data, etc. which can be appropriately used to aid in decision making so as to streamline the production process, reduce costs and increase profits while providing benefits like speed and reliability at virtually no cost.
